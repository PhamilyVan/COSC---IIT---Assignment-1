    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The project is about utilising machine learning techniques to make coffee machines able to predict, learn, and produce
      coffee for the user automatically. To improve the accuracy of the algorithm, a mobile application will also be developed,
      where it captures the data on when a user has coffee and what type of coffee they have. A raspberry pi that is loaded with
      the algorithm and data, is connected to the coffee machine processor and executes the command to make coffee when it believes
      it should. The mobile application and raspberry pi are connected via Bluetooth.</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>Have you ever felt the urge to brew a cup of coffee, but were too lazy to do so? Have you ever felt rushed in the
      morning and instead of making yourself a cup at home, you buy one on the way to work? Using a raspberry pi or Arduino,
      we can connect our Bluetooth devices and automate our coffee machines to ensure that you never miss out on your coffee.
      I think this project would be interesting as it would provide an insight on what a smart home could potentially look like.
      Furthermore, smart technology has the capability to improve many aspects of a person’s life, such as convenience, where
      some people claim that it saves them “at least 30 minutes on a daily basis” (Smiljanic Stasha, 2020). </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The coffee machine that we will be using is “Kogan Expresso Manual Coffee Machine” model, where it has the option to
      brew an expresso, drip coffee, latte and cappuccinos. This is where the raspberry pi will be installed, sitting beside
      or inside the coffee machine to facilitate Bluetooth communication between a user mobile interface with the machine. This
      is not to say that the project will be a mobile application that allows the user to interact with the coffee machine. The
      raspberry pi will be running an algorithm, using the Python framework, “Tensorflow”, in order to be able to utilize machine
      learning techniques and paradigms.
      <br></br>
      The algorithm itself will be an unsupervised learning, whereby it determines whether its predictions are correct; and in
      doing so, allows for the algorithm to learn patterns and consequently, improving its accuracy in the long term.
      <br></br>
      The mobile application will simple be a means of transferring data between the user and the coffee machine, where the
      raspberry pi’s algorithm can learn from. The data, which is stored locally on a user’s mobile, will be very direct questions
      such as “Did you enjoy this morning’s coffee?”, “Did I make the coffee in time?”, where these categorical data can be stored
      directly, without the need to clean and manipulate it. These questions allow for the machine to make better decisions and to
      be able to be more accurate in the future, which is paramount for the project.
      <br></br>
      The user will, upon activation of the machine and downloading of the application, will be prompted to make an estimation
      of their current coffee routine, such as their type of coffee that they usually drink and the time in which they make their
      coffee per day. Based on the time that the user drinks, after the first use of automation, the mobile application will
      trigger questions as pop-ups.
      <br></br>
      At the beginning of use, the mobile application would send over this data to the raspberry pi daily as to try and improve
      the algorithm’s effectiveness. In the long term, the frequency in which data is transmitted would be reduced. This may
      be after an accuracy milestone has been achieved or after a large amount of data is gathered.
      <br></br>
      We will also be utilizing motion detection as just relying on the algorithm, that is based on time, quite risky in terms
      of success. Most mobile phones have in-built motion detection. By detecting whether a user has moved their phones as a
      sign of being woken up, it will relay that information to the raspberry pi and checks if it in an acceptable range of
      time from its prediction to start brewing.
      <br></br>
      When we put it all together, when the user wakes up and decides to get their coffee, all they need to do is press the
      dispenser button on the machine and they will get a fresh cup of coffee. It should be noted that the process of automation
      here is not limited to when you’re about to go to work only. If the user also likes to study and drink coffee to boost
      their productivity, they can simply go into the mobile application and adjust their times when they have coffee.
      <br></br>
      The only parts that require human interaction are filling up the water storage container, filling in coffee blend in
      another compartment, and pressing the button to dispense. However, these are miniscule in terms of the time it takes to
      blend a cup of coffee and not automating these factors will have miniscule effects on the product.
    </p>

    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p>The tools required for this project would be any machine that can be operated by using buttons, such as the
      “Kogan Expresso Manual Coffee Machine”, where the cheaper the better. We would also need a raspberry pi model 3 onwards,
      hooked up to the coffee machine, as to collect data via a mobile application. The raspberry pi would have an algorithm,
      written in python using the TensorFlow framework, allowing the software to utilize machine learning. The mobile
      application used to interact with the raspberry pi would be written using React Native framework. </p>

      <h2>Skills Required</h2>
      <p>The skills required for this project include:
        <ul style = "text-align:center; width:1200px; margin-left:10%; background-color:#ffb3b3; list-style-position: inside;">
        <li>The knowledge of how to use React Native to create the mobile application, </li>
        <li>The ability to code in python and use TensorFlow framework to create the algorithm for unsupervised learning and</li>
        <li>Electrical Engineering knowledge, as to connect the raspberry pi to the coffee machine.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      <p>I believe that both the software and hardware component of creating this project can be achieved through self-study via
      tutorials, books and other online resources. The algorithm won’t be based on too many attributes and therefore, the
      complexity of it will also not be that hard implement. As someone without any electrical engineering experience, the
      process of connecting the raspberry pi to the computer chip in the coffee machine seems daunting, but as the coffee
      machine processor is not very complex, I think that this too can be achieved through adequate research.</p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>If successful, the original problem of not being able to have a cup of coffee at home will be solved. There are
          several positive outcomes that come from this automation such as saving money from buying coffee and saving time spent
          making coffee. As the act of making coffee a daily action for many people, it’s not hard to see how different aspects
          of one’s life can also be automated and improved. For those that enjoy taking baths, the long wait of drawing water can
          also be automated. For those that have automatic lights that turn on based on motion, implementing this project’s
          technology will allow for a smarter design in adapting to the current brightness of the room. It is also practical in
          an environmental sense as the technology is optimised to minimise waste.</p>
