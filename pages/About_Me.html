      <p style="text-align:center;">My name is Van Pham, student number s3788106, email of s3788106@student.rmit.edu.au and studying in
        Bachelor of Information Technology. I was previously enrolled in Computer Science but opted to change courses.
        The reasons being: Enrolling in a program that is more suited towards my capabilities and freeing up time to
        pursue other professional interests (being data analytics and data science) as well as leisure.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center;">Born in Australia with a Vietnamese descent which oxymoronically, I don’t think I could wholly
        identify as an Australian or as a Vietnamese. Despite that, I can appreciate both cultures such as
        celebrating Lunar New year or having a barbeque on a summer’s day. I can speak English, Vietnamese
        and in the recent years, have picked up Japanese. A fact that one might find interesting about me is
        that I’m an avid gamer, especially the genres of First-Person Shooters and Role-Playing Games. My
        favourite titles are “Counter-Strike Global Offensive” and “Skyrim”.</p>
