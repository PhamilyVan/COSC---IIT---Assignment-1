      <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
    </header>

    <div style="border: 2px solid black;">

    <h2>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
    <p>Before starting my studies at RMIT, whenever the term “IT” came up in conversation, I would always
      think of Artificial Intelligent Systems, Machine Learning and an Interconnected world using Technology.
      Those assumptions were heavily influenced by Japanese films such as “Ghost in the shell” and “Time of Eve” as
      well as games like “Deus Ex”. The conceptualisation of what a future society that is intertwined with technology
      has fascinated me ever since enjoying these medias a few years back. Rather than just watching by the sideline,
      pursuing a career in IT, where I could create these technologies seemed much more appealing to me, hence my
      enrolment at RMIT. </p>

    <h2>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience</h2>
    <p>After having studied for a couple of years with exposure to software development using Java, Databases and
      many other disciplines, my interest (much the same as before studying at RMIT) largely remains the same in
      Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Analytics. More specifically, I would someday like to create
      a self-thinking, intelligent system. Examples of developments in Artificial Intelligence that has piqued my
      interest in recent years includes Tesla’s self-driving cars, the robot Sophia and OpenAI’s Dota 2 AI. </p>

    <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT</h2>
    <p>I chose RMIT university because I believed that studying here would provide me with a good foundation towards my goals,
      although rudimentary in aspects of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I believe the demand for IT
      professionals both in general as well as in the field of Data Science is only going to increase with each
      passing year and studying at RMIT will equip me with the necessary fundamentals to pursue my ideal careers as a
      Data Scientist/Data Analyst.  </p>

    <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies</h2>
    <p>During my studies, I expect to learn about other technologies in software development, statistics and working
      as a team to name a few. I also expect to undertake courses that explore my ideal field of study such as Machine
      Learning. Studying with a reputable university will provide more selections when it comes to my minor and
      elective subjects, which will provide me with a better opportunity to explore other areas of interest like
      Economics and Japanese.   </p>
