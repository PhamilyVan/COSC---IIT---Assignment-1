      <p>The Job of a Fraud Data Analyst entails using data in order to detect and prevent fraudulent banking activities through
        analysing banking accounts, financial transactions and other datasets to gain insight on the source as well as legality of funds.
        An ideal job for me is one that comprises, but is not limited to the following factors:
      </p>
      <p>•	Pay: A job that pays at least industry average and scales according to experience and inflation is highly desirable.
        The role is advertised for at least $100,000, which allows me to work towards my financial plans such as saving for retirement
        or buying a house. Getting slightly paid less than this would not be a deal breaker but would still invite a sense of not
        being valued as I would want my work to be rewarded fairly.</p>

      <p>•	Flexibility: A hybrid of in office and work from home environment, given the pandemic, is a very appealing aspect
        of this position. Being able to work from home would free up time when it comes to travel, which in turn, would allow for
        more time towards leisure and relaxation. Being in office would allow me to better understand the dataset, the problem to
        be solved and ways to approach it as I have not background in finance.</p>

      <p>•	Fulfilling: Being able to make a positive difference on society is a luxury that not many people can say when it
        comes to their work. Being able to detect fraud has 2 direct net positives. Those being the apprehension of the culprit as
        well as helping the aggrieved victims reunite with their funds. </p>

      <p>•	Culture: Boasting about winning workplace culture shows some level of a good working environment. Further
        investigation on their website, I got the impression that the working environment is not very formal, which is a
        positive as it allows for direct dialogue. I would not want to work for an organisation that is fixated on business
        norms such as etiquette and hierarchy, where it impedes the existence of a normal conversation, regardless of position.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center; background-color:#ffb3b3; width:1200px; margin-left:10%;">Required Skills, Qualifications, Experience:</h2>
        <h4 style="text-align:center; background-color:#ffb3b3; width:1200px; margin-left:10%; ">Technical:</h4>

        <ul style = "text-align:center; width:1200px; margin-left:10%; background-color:#ffb3b3; list-style-position: inside;">
        <li>Have experience in manipulating raw data and transforming it into a usable and meaningful way</li>
        <li>Have experience in using SQL in searching for relevant data in the database</li>
        <li>Transform the findings into insights such as visual charts that can be easily conveyed to non-technical stakeholders</li>
        <li>To have background in understanding and working with financial data.</li>
        <li>Experience in a similar field of fraud detection.</li>
        </ul>

          <h4 style="text-align:center; background-color:#ffb3b3; width:1200px; margin-left:10%; ">Non-Technical:</h4>
          <ul style = "text-align:center; width:1200px; margin-left:10%; background-color:#ffb3b3; list-style-position: inside;">
            <li>Being able to think analytically by following logical and sounding reasoning to come up with a solution.</li>
            <li>To be able to communicate technical aspects of the data analysis in an easy-to-understand way so that even non-technical stakeholders can understand.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2 style="text-align:center; background-color:#ffb3b3; width:1200px; margin-left:10%;">Skills, Qualifications, Experience that I have:</h2>
          <p>In terms of technical skills, I am very familiar and comfortable, albeit a bit rusty, regarding the duties as a data analyst. I have taken courses
            in SQL, statistics, python and data analytics and have created a handful of projects that showcase my technical skills in
            extracting and cleaning datasets, critically thinking and justifying the main steps of code and highlighting my findings
            visually in Matplotlib and Seaborn Python libraries.
            <br></br>
            Regarding Non-Technical skills, I believe the aspects of critical thinking, justified by critiquing each step in the workflow of a data analyst
            could be showcased in previous projects. I believe that even if a non-technical person had a glance of my
            JupyterNotebook, they would be able to dissect a general understanding of my work.
          </p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center; background-color:#ffb3b3; width:1200px; margin-left:10%;">Plan for obtaining required skills for position:</h2>
        <p>Although I believe I could be a good candidate when it comes to the technical aspects as a data analyst, I would
          need to do an immense amount of revision and looking at past projects as it has been quite a while since I’ve done
          anything data analytics related. <br></br>
          As someone who has little background in finance, I would need to search up the possible different financial
          instruments used to store data. These include financial statements, balance sheets and more. I think a good starting
          point would use online resources such as google and tutorials to understand their functions as well as terminology used. <br></br>
          Lastly, it would be useful to carry out a personal project that relates to fraud detection, to further improve my
          skills as a data analyst. Doing so would also allow some insights to be gained involving the financial parts of the
          position.
