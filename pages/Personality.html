      <h4 style="text-align:center; background-color:#ffb3b3">Myers-Briggs</h4>
      <p style="text-align:center; width:1200px; margin-left:10%; background-color:#ffb3b3;">Myers-Briggs: There are aspects to the analysis in which I agree and disagree with. Firstly, for the sections that I found profound was being scored as an Introvert and Intuitive. The description of Introvert suggests that I get exhausted from social interaction, in which I find true from a general perspective. I wouldn’t particularly say that I’m shy, but when in a discussion, often I start off strong, but after a while, I get exhausted and burnt out and consequently, tend to just sit and listen.
I also find being categorised as intuitive highly agreeable. It describes me as imaginative, open-minded and curious as well as focusing on future possibilities rather than concrete idea. I do enjoy playing with the ideas of what will happen in the future, both personally as well as socially. What kind of life will I have in 5,10 years’ time? Will I have achieved my dreams by then? What will future cities look like? How much of society will have been integrated by automation? I also find the point of being open-minded agreeable. Although making preconceived assumptions is an inevitable in everyone, I try to keep those notions in check by putting myself in other’s position.
Subsequently, there are categories in which I find aspects that are true, as well as false. Those being the Feeling and Assertive results. Firstly, the description of being less competitive under the Feeling category true as often, I don’t push myself to the accord of others in order to prove myself, but rather, take it at my own pace. I like to challenge myself for my own benefit and dislike the concept of competition. On the other hand, it described me as sensitive and emotionally expressive which I don’t find entirely agreeable. I do know that at time, I can be sensitive, in situations where I feel targeted without a valid motive as well as not having my inputs fairly heard, although most times, I keep those emotions suppressed and deal with them intrinsically. I don’t find myself emotionally expressive, rather, I tend to find myself thinking before speaking.
I also challenge some of the descriptions of being assertive. I find it true that I try not to worry too much and don’t push myself in pursuit of my own goals. That is to say that I take my own pace that I feel comfortable in working towards my goals. That point that I find dumbstruck is being resistant to stress. I’m not the type that can push through tasks and ignore the feeling of being overwhelmed and stress. I would say that I break down my goals into manageable tasks to ease the burden and when I feel overwhelmed or mentally exhausted, I take a break and enjoy games, movies and the like.
The last point in which I find completely opposite of who I am is the category of Prospecting as it describes me as being very good at improvising. There have been many encounters where I’ve been forced into the spotlight and either I don’t know how to react or stutter my way through and response. I’m the type that entertains ideas in thought before I express them verbally and because of this, I could not improvise to save my life. Secondly, I find being flexible a point of contention.
